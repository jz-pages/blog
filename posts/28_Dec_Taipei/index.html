Beautiful landscapes, delicious food, familiarity with their culture and friendly birds(most important) made Taiwan an obvious choice.    </p>    <p>        Although birds were not the priority, I still managed to tick many of the endemics along the way.    </p>    <p>        We stayed in an AirBnb in the middle of Xindian old street where we had easy access to plenty of food options and public transport, while being far enough away from the city.        Apparently AirBnbs are illegal and we found out at the immigration when officers asked for our accomodation address    </p>    <h2>Day 1 : Bitan & Shilin</h2>    <p>        First day we decided to take it a little bit slower because of a flight delay that made us reach our accommodation after midnight.         After having a soothing bowl of bone broth noodles for breakfast, we headed out to the nearby riverside park for a stroll. <b>Black drongos</b> perched on cables sallied for insects in the early morning while <b>glossy starlings</b> and <b>oriental turtle doves</b> were just getting ready to start the day.        <b>Black-collared starlings</b> and <b>common mynas</b> squabbled for crumbs in somebody's balcony.    </p>    <div class="img-group">        <div class="img-container">            <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/WhatsAppImage2025022.jpeg">            <p>Pork soup bee hoon with braised sides</p>        </div>        <div class="img-container">            <img loading="lazy" src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/IMG20241229090318.jpg" alt="">            <p>Bitan scenic area</p>        </div>        <div class="img-container">            <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/IMG2831.jpg">            <p>A wintering <b>brown shrike</b> posing for the camera</p>        </div>    </div>    <p>        Along the river edge, <b>black-crowned night-herons</b> and <b>grey herons</b> kept a close watch on 3 <b>black kites</b> and a <b>crested serpent eagle</b> circling above.        The a short hike in small forested hill by the river yielded  a bird wave of <b>white-bellied erponis</b> and <b>light-vented bulbuls</b>.         A single <b>osprey</b> thermalled in the morning sun, barely gaining any height.    </p>    <p>        On the way back to our apartment, the melodious singing of a <b>taiwan whistling-thrush</b> from an overgrown roof garden caught my attention. Never expected to find such a specialised bird in the suburbs.    </p>    <p>        We spent the evening at Chiang Kai sek shilin residence where I managed to do a little birding.        The grass patches were filled with <b>cattle egret</b> and a few <b>grey wagtails</b>. It was oddly quiet with not many birds moving around because of a <b>besra</b> perched on a dead tree.         When it left, a huge flock of <b>black bulbuls</b> moved in to a large fruiting tree followed by <b>taiwan barbets</b> and <b>rufous treepies</b>.         Down in the understory, many little brown birds were passing by and among them I spotted 2 <b>black-naped monarchs</b> and a group of <b>Taiwan scimitar babblers</b>.        The fruiting ardisia trees attracted many beautiful <b>Taiwan blue magpies</b>.    </p>    <div class="img-group">        <div class="img-container"><img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/IMG2938.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></div>        <div class="img-container"><img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/IMG2972.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></div>        <div class="img-container"><img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/IMG2916.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></div>    </div>    <h2>Day 2 : Taipingshan tour</h2>    <p>        On the second day, we booked a tour to taipingshan on klook. The itenary and driver was great although it was a little rushed.     </p>    <p>The first stop was jianqing huaigu trail. It's an abandoned logging railway track going through a coniferous forest.         Moss, lichens and various other epiphytes encrusted themselves on every possible hard surface giving the place a mystical vibe.        Taiwan just had a cold spell the last few days and we were not prepared for 7 &deg;C cold winds.        Beautiful scenery but nothing out of the ordinary for a birder.    </p>    <div class="img-group" >        <div class="img-container">            <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/IMG20241230100035.jpg" style="max-height:50vh;">        </div>        <div class="img-container">            <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/IMG20241230095356.jpg" style="max-height:50vh;">        </div>    </div>    <p>        The whole place was generally very quiet, occasionally a cricket would break the silence. Temperature hovered around 10 degrees celsius the whole time we were there.        We spent the next 1 hour around taipingshan villa area.        The only birds I managed to find at these high elevations was a single skulky <b>taiwan cupwing</b>, a flock of <b>whiskered laughingthrushes</b> and a wintering <b>pale thrush</b>.        The lack of activity might be due to it being winter and all the birds are at lower elevations.    </p>    <p>        The next destination was an jiuzhizhe hot springs where more time was allocated for us to enjoy soaking in the hotsprings.        I immediately made my way to the nature trail and was utterly dissapointed by the silence.         As I awkwardly exchanged glances with a passing rat snake, bird chatters started close in.    </p>    <p>        High up in the conifers flitted about <b>chestnut-bellied tits</b>, that anchored the seeds they foraged under their feet before hammering them open with their strong beaks.        Following them were pairs of <b>grey-chinned minivets</b>, <b>bronzed drongos</b> and a <b>taiwan vivid niltava</b> sallying for insects in the mid-storey.        The mid-storey gleaning party consisted of <b>white-bellied erponis</b>, <b>rufous-capped babblers</b> and a pair of <b>taiwan yellow tits</b>.        <b>Taiwan yuhinas</b> and <b>green-backed tits</b> hopped about in the ground ferns. A few fruiting trees scattered around attracted the ever present <b>taiwan barbets</b> and <b>white-eared sibia</b>.      </p>    <p>        On the way out, our driver brought us to a tea shop(茶之乡专业茶园) to have a short break and have a snack. The long winding road made me naseous and I had little appetite.        A <b>black eagle</b> floated gracefully above the canopy at the edge of the property while we warmed up on the free-flow tea provided.    </p>    <p>        Along the road back to the city, I spotted a male <b>swinhoe's pheasant</b> foraging in an abandoned betel nut farm.        There was nothing I could do but watch as this possibly once in a lifetime opportunity vanish behind the passing brush.    </p>    <h2>Day 3 : Wulai</h2>    <p>        The next day we took the first bus to wulai old town to have a hike.         Wulai has a good reputation of being a good location to find lowland forest birds like the highly sought after maroon oriole.         But the trails we walked were not the trails birders frequently go. On one side is a steep climb upwards, on the other, a sheer drop into the river.    </p>    <p>        At a small tributary in the old town, a <b>plumbeous water redstart</b> bathed in the cold mountain stream and preened on the balcony of the shophouses.        On the rocks along the main river, a pair of <b>brown dippers</b> were collecting moss for their nest under a huge boulder.    </p>    <p>Flocks of <b>grey-chinned minivet</b>, <b>morrisson's fulvetta</b> and <b>rufous-capped babblers</b> moved along the valley slopes in large numbers.</p>    <p>        The walk along Xinfu road and xinxian trail yielded yielded nothing.         Bird activity only improved when we reached flat ground at a small village where I met the typical mixed flock of <b>blue magpies</b> and <b>taiwan scimitar-babblers</b>.        Further down at neidong entrance, a flock of agitated <b>taiwan yuhina</b> and a <b>pale thrush</b> appearred to mob a predator I could not spot.    </p>    <p>        The nature trail at neidong was very challenging. The ground was paved with pebbles that were covered in wet mud, making it very slippery.         Pairing it with a constant steep ascent, it was quite dangerous to climb.         Midway, I came across a pair of <b>black-necklaced scimitar-babblers</b> deep in the vegetation.         While observing them, a rustle in the understory gave away the position of a <b>taiwan partridge</b> sneakily crossing the path.        Near the end of the trail, I flushed a poor muntjac which granted judgemental looks from a group of <b>black-throated laughingthrush</b>.    </p>    <p>        Stumbled upon a female <b>swinhoe's pheasant</b> while rushing back to the town.    </p>    <h2>Day 4 : Erbazi botanical garden</h2>    <p>On the last day, my mother wanted to sleep in.         The past few days have been quite tiring even for me.         So my father accompanied me early in the morning to a nearby park that had recent sightings of maroon orioles.        </p>         <p> The park is tucked away in the corner of a housing district and gets plenty of traffic from the elderly residents.         One of them left a pile of peanuts near the entrance which attracted the usually canopy-dwelling <b>rufous treepies</b> down to the ground.         There was also a raccous group of <b>rufous-crowned laughingthrush</b> which didn't seem interested in the peanuts.    </p>         <p>         Carpark 2 is were majority of the activity was at. In a low shrub, <b>white-eared sibia</b> and <b>taiwan scimitar-babbler</b> skulked.        A few <b>Taiwan bamboo partridges</b> were calling but none were willing to show themselves. Might be due to the many stray cats lurking around the park.        A <b>Taiwan vivid niltava</b> stared down a <b>grey-capped pygmy-woodpecker</b> on a dead tree before flying off.    </p>    <p>        We continued along the winding and hilly path, passing a small shrine and a few houses, thinking about how nice it would be to retire in a place like this.        Before long, we came across another group of scimitar-babblers. This time however, they were completely out the open and unafraid of humans.        They were not the only ones like usual. Magpies and treepies chattered noisily as they crossed the road into somebody's property.         While I was admiring the magpies, my father called me over saying something red flew past. As I was racking my brain for a possible identification,         I saw a flash of red. And there it was, 5 meters away in the bamboo thicket perched the <b>Maroon oriole</b>.    </p>      <div class="img-group">        <div class="img-container">            <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/IMG20250101093803.jpg" style="max-height: 60vh;">        </div>        <div class="img-container">            <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/IMG3469.jpg" style="max-height: 60vh;">        </div>        <div class="img-container">            <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/IMG20250101071721.jpg" style="max-height: 60vh;">        </div>    </div>    <p>        We saw a total of 38 identiable species, excluding the many waterfowl and waders I never bothered to look out for while on the road. Would definitely want to experience the Taiwanese highlands for when I decide to come here again.    </p>    <h2>eBird checklists</h2>    <p>        <a href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S207400263">Taipingshan cypress trail</a>    </p>    <p>        <a href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S217827298">Jiuzhizhe hotsprings</a>    </p>    <p>        <a href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S207294019">Wulai</a>    </p>    <p>        <a href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S207400019">Erbazi botanical garden</a>    </p></div>            </div>        </div>    </div>    </body></html>
