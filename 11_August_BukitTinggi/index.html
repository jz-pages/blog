Most of the people I know weren't free during that period but luckily my friend sze kai was willing to take a day leave to accompany me.                </p>                <p>                    So after a quick discussion, we decided to go to Bukit tinggi.                </p>                <p>                    Bukit tinggi is a hill just a little down the highway from genting Highlands. At 800m, it is not high enough for montane forests but is nevertheless very productive for birding. We encountered frequent bird waves in the morning and evenings, and even in the afternoons there were still bulbuls fluttering about. The main birding areas are around the Japanese garden, tho the road from the hotel is decent too.                </p>                                <h2>Accommodation</h2>                <p>                    Since we both don't drive, we stayed in Colmar Tropicale, a french themed village in Bukit tinggi 3km away from the main birding area. It costed about 200rm for one night + 13rm Pahang tax. Quite expensive considering the condition of the hotel.                </p>                                <h2>Transport</h2>                <p>                    We managed to get a grab from the city for 80rm. The hotel also provides shuttle bus service from berjaya times square to Colmar tropicale and back, 38rm per person.                    But only at 8am and 4pm.                </p>                <p>                    <a target="_blank" href="https://colmartropicale.com.my/getting-here/">More info here</a>                </p>                <p>                    There is also an hourly shuttle from the village to Japanese garden free of charge, from 10am to 4pm.                    However u are most likely going to be hiking up the 250m elevation 3km road at dawn if you didn't drive.                 </p>                                                <h2>Food</h2>                <p>                    There are a few restaurants, a 7 eleven and Starbucks at Colmar tropicale but we didn't visit any of them as they had terrible reviews on Google.                </p>                <div class="img-container">                    <img loading="lazy" src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/b0eWhatsAppImage2024102.jpeg" alt="">                    <p>Delicious nasi goreng from The Chateau Spa & Resorts</p>                </div>                <p>                    We had lunch and dinner at a restaurant at The Chateau Spa & Resorts further up which had generous portions and tasty food for only a few dollars more expensive (we only tried nasi goreng).                </p>                                <h2>Birding</h2>                <p>We arrived at about 4pm at the hotel to check in and take the next shuttle bus up to the japanese garden.                    Since it was already so late when we made it to the garden, we did not expect to find much, but it was surprisingly busy.                </p>                <p>                    Flocks of <b>cinereous bulbuls</b> and <b>black-crested bulbuls</b>, and a single <b>gray-bellied bulbul</b> gathered at the fruiting trees surrounding the carpark with a few <b>verditer flycatchers</b> darting about.                    4 <b>velvet-fronted nuthatches</b> climbed up and down the trees giving us incredible eye-level views which otherwise would be difficult to photograph in their usual lowland habitats.                </p>                <p>                    As the sky was getting dark, we quickly head for the feeding station to scout the area.                    Upon reaching the hide, we ticked our first target, the <b>ferruginous partridge</b>, poking about at the leaf litter, unpeturbed by our presence.                </p>                <div class="img-container">                    <img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/IMG1630.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy">                    <p>One hopped onto a branch to check for danger before heading back into the forest</p>                </div>                <p>A <b>malaysian rail-babbler</b> was calling in the distance and a pair of woodpeckers calling in the trees above us which we suspect could be greater yellownapes, but we could not get any visuals. No pic no talk as they say.</p>                               <div class="divider"></div>                <p>The next day started early.</p>                <p>                    We started hiking up the long road at about 5:30am to try for some nocturnal birds. There were the usual <b>sunda scops owls</b> and a distant <b>blyth's frogmouth</b> calling but nothing out of the ordinary.                </p>                <div class="img-container">                    <img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/WhatsAppImage2024102.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="">                    <p>The whole sky was filled with stars, something city people like us rarely get to experience</p>                </div>                <p>                    The forest around the hide was already bustling with activity when we arrived.                     A huge mixed flock consisting of mostly <b>sooty barbets</b> with the ever present cinereous bulbuls moved through the forest noisily while                    a pair of <b>sunda scimitar babblers</b> followed close behind but were very difficult to photograph due to their hyperactive nature.                </p>                <p>                    <b>Buff-breasted babblers</b> and <b>ochraceous bulbuls</b> darted in and out of the vegetation to steal a few morsels of food offerings for the main star of show.                </p>                <p>Before long, a female <b>mountain peacock-pheasant</b> strolled onto the stage. Despite not having the extravagant tail feathers of the males, it was a delight to watch her feeding comfortably and displaying natural behaviours which would be almost impossible to witness if not for the hide.</p>                <div class="img-container">                    <img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/693WhatsAppImage2024102.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="">                    <p>Searching for the calling orange-breasted trogon</p>                </div>                <p>                    With our SD cards filled and hearts content, we went to the road leading to the hide to do some birding.                    We got some terrible views of a <b>green broadbill</b> which was calling incessantly while we were at the hide.                    We also managed to tick another target of the trip, the <b>orange-breasted trogon</b>, a hill specialist that is apparently quite easy to find here. We managed to see another 2 more at another trail.                    The gingers planted along the path also attracted a <b>grey-breasted spiderhunter</b>. Nectarivores seem to be rather sparse here.                </p>                                <p>                    At the entrance of the Japanese garden was a clearing where a landslide happened with a few fruiting trees which attracted many frugivores.                    The activity here was nothing like I have experienced. Flocks of canopy birds passed by every few minutes giving ample photography opportunities and non-stop action.                </p>                <p>                    Barbets were everywhere. <b>Sooty barbets</b> and <b>blue-eared barbets</b> zipped around, occasionally stopping to sing and feed.                    A <b>gold-whiskered barbet</b> chanted its repetitive song from a high perch while a <b>yellow-crowned barbet</b> was inspecting a potential nesting hole.                </p>                <p>                    <b>Raffles malkoha</b>, <b>chestnut-breasted malkoha</b> and <b>chestnut-bellied malkoha</b> took turns to glide across the clearing.                    They were closely followed by a <b>lesser-racket tailed drongo</b>, <b>fiery minivets</b> and <b>bar-winged flycatcher-shrikes</b>, hoping to catch the insects that get flushed by the malkoha.                </p>                <p>                    A pair of <b>wreathed hornbills</b> flew past while the song of gibbons echoed throughout the valley.                </p>                <p>                    While we were scanning the bird waves, sze kai spotted a very rare <b>helmeted hornbill</b> perched far away through a small gap in the trees.                </p>                                <div class="img-container">                    <img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/j20155392/IMG1928.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="">                </div>                <p>                    As we were about to leave, we came across a pair of siamang singing loudly next to the road.                </p>                <p>                    On the way down, I managed to catch a glimpse of a <b>rufous-bellied swallow</b>.                </p>                                <h2>Half day at kepong botanical garden</h2>                <p>                    Since we only had a morning on the last day of our trip, we decided to check out kepong botanical gardens at KL. We arrived too early and the park wasn't open yet so we took a stroll along the fence. There were already a few residents doing the same and waiting for the gates to open.                 </p>                <p>                    The park was surrounded by mature secondary forests and we could hear broadbills, barbets and black-capped babblers calling from the edge.                    Unfortunately, the skywalk and boardwalk that leads deeper into the forest were closed.                </p>                <p>                    Upon entering the park, we heard incessant chirping from the canopy. It was coming from an <b>indian cuckoo</b> begging it's host parent, a <b>black-and-yellow broadbill</b>, for food. The parents tirelessly brought grasshoppers to the chick 3 times their size. They would often perch unbothered beside the path, giving us great views.                    Just a few meters away, a lone <b>raffles malkoha</b> was foraging among the low saplings. Despite being a common bird in Malaysia, it was still quite surprising to see it extending into parkland habitat.                </p>                <p>                    A walk around the park didn't bring us any birds, maybe we were unlucky.                </p>                <div class="divider"></div>                <h2>eBird checklists:</h2>                <p>                    <a target="_blank" href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S191026511">11 August Bukit tinggi</a>                </p>                <p>                    <a target="_blank" href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S191141324">12 August Bukit tinggi</a>                </p>                <p>                    <a target="_blank" href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S191258785">13 August Taman botani kepong</a>                </p>            </div>        </div>    </div>    </body></html>
